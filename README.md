# Advent of Code 2020

Another repository of possible solutions on how to save Christmas, by solving the daily puzzles thrown at us at [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/).

## What to Expect?

The puzzles of first days are small and simple, but they get gradually more complicated as the days pass. I enjoyed the Advent of Code challenges last year (2019) and managed to solve all the challenges up until December 18th (about 2/3 of all the challenges during that season), before they became too time consuming to carry on, and I gave up at that point. Let's see, how it goes this year.

If you observe the [public leaderbord](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard) of the challenge, you might notice there are people who solve the puzzles really fast, literally in minutes after the opening of the new daily puzzle -- the top of the leaderboard is populated by [competitive programmers or sport programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming), who are training and doing these kinds of stuff all year around. When they solve these puzzles, their primary aim is to get to correct answers in the fastest possible coding time, and that is usually not the good approach in any other normal software development situation where you have to write readable and maintainable code. Sport programmers take a lots of shortcuts and don't care about the readability and maintainability of the code, because that is not the goal, they literally optimize for crossing the finish-line in the shortest possible time. Some of those people have been doing YouTube screen-casts on their own real-time performance -- you can definitely find examples of them if you search "Advent of Code" in YouTube.

In the solutions provided here, we have a different goal.

Here, the goal is not to reach finish-line fast, but just reach the working solution in amount of time that is reasonable to have fun, while paying attention on code readability and maintainability. It is to give an example on how someone with more than 25 years of software engineering experience is approaching those puzzles in a diggestible manner. The aim here is to be educational and/or have some relaxed tech-geek Christmas fun, rather than be a competitive show-off.

Primary tools that are used: Python 3 as language, Jupyter Lab as coding environment, and NumPy and Pandas as primary frameworks for easier vectorized data processing. This is the initial plan. Probably there will be puzzles that trigger some interesting choices of alternative approaches to be made. In more notable cases, when this happens, I'll add here the relevant keywords.

## Screencasts

I managed to create some screencasts of solving the puzzles in real-time as well:
- [Day 1](https://youtu.be/uVpnJURhRRs) -- fixing the expense reports: 26 minutes, both parts of the day.
- [Day 5](https://youtu.be/tDpkhOmM6Ps) -- checking the flight boarding passes and finding the seat. 40 minutes, both parts of the day.
- [Day 6](https://youtu.be/anJOnFPjJps) -- counting the yes-answers on customs declarations.
